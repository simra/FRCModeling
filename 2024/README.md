## Steps:
1. `python fetchMatches.py --year 2024 --reset`

    You can optionally pass --reset to re-pull all the data, and --year YEAR to pull data for a year other than 2024.  

2. `runScoutingReport.py`

3. Web page: 
    - backend\  - python flask app
    - frontend\ - react front-end


4. Model generation is in OPR.py.  See runScoutingReport for an example of how it's used.
